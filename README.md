## Ideation:
 - A system for taxi cab drivers (or Lyft, Uber, etc) that takes their GPS tracks plus the pickup/dropoff times and locations and recommends loops to drive in that will likely put them near people that need a ride for a given time of day.(An app for taxi drivers..they could know which location to concentrate or go in loops so that they attract maximum customers)
